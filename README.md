# core-service

Our core service

## Overview

This template provides the necessary infrastructure to run a containerized application on a scalable, serverless platform. It includes:

-   A **VPC** with public and private subnets.
-   An **Application Load Balancer** to distribute traffic.
-   An **ECS Fargate Service** to run your container.
-   An **ECR Repository** to store your Docker image.
-   All necessary **Security Groups** and **IAM Roles**.

The infrastructure code is located in the `infra/` directory and is managed by Terraform. The application code and `Dockerfile` are located in the `app/` directory.

## How to Use

First, navigate to the `infra` directory:
```sh
cd infra
```

Then, you can initialize and deploy the infrastructure:

1.  **Initialize Terraform:**
    ```sh
    terraform init
    ```

2.  **Plan the deployment:**
    Review the `variables.tf` file for available parameters. You can create a `terraform.tfvars` file to specify your application's name and other settings.
    ```sh
    terraform plan
    ```

3.  **Apply the configuration:**
    Confirm the plan to deploy your application.
    ```sh
    terraform apply
    ```

## Customization

-   **Application Code**: The application source code and `Dockerfile` are located in the `app/` directory. You can replace the contents of this directory with your own application.
-   **Infrastructure**: The Terraform code is in the `infra/` directory. You can modify service parameters like CPU, memory, and desired count by editing the files within this directory.
